# over my dead body
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter  
'Cause you know I'm okay  
Instead, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"  
When you know, you know I'm the same  
I know, I know you don't love me, baby  
They're trying to take you away from me  
Only over my dead body

I think I killed everybody in the game last year  
Man, fuck it, I was on though  
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club, mm-mm  
Fuck it, I was wrong though  
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free  
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me  
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some (win some)  
Long as the outcome is income  
You know I want it all and then some  
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum  
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from  
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from  
Yeah, you know me well, nigga  
Yeah, I mean you ain't the only real nigga  
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga  
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yeah  
Are these people really discussing my career again?  
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again  
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?  
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?  
Man, all of your flows bore me, paint drying  
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine  
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine  
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time  
Yeah, it's been that way from the beginning  
I just been playing, I ain't even notice I was winning  
And this is the only sound you should fear  
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

Oh, I know you don't love me, baby  
They're trying to take you away from me  
Only over my dead body

You say I'm old news, well who the new star?  
'Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far  
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States  
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case  
Red wine over Fed time  
But shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time  
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime  
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time  
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy  
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start, boy  
Or you wanna be a muthafuckin' funny guy?  
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy  
Yeah, it's whatever  
You know, feeling good, living better  
I think maybe I was numb to it last year  
But you know I feel it now more than ever  
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay  
Second album, I'm back paving the way  
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon  
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day  
And I met your baby moms last night  
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it  
And I was drinking at the Palms last night  
And ended up losing everything that I came with  
Yeah, feel like I've been here before, huh?  
I still got ten years to go, huh?  
And this is the only sound you should fear  
Man, these kids wear crowns over here  
And everything is all right

Oh, I know you don't love me, baby (woo)  
They're trying to take you away from me  
Only over my dead body
# shot for me

I can see it in your eyes, you're angry  
Regret got shit on what you're feeling now  
Mad 'cause he ain't like me  
Oh you mad 'cause nobody ever did it like me  
All the care I would take, all the love that we made  
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you  
It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alisha, Catya  
I know that you gon' hear this  
I'm the man  
Yeah I said it  
Bitch I'm the man  
Don't you forget it  
The way you walk, that's me  
The way you talk, that's me  
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?  
And the voice in the speaker right now, that's me, that's me  
And the voice in your ear, that's me  
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it  
First I made you who you are, then I made it

And you're wasted with your ladies

Yeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded

Take a shot for me (hooooooo-ooooooh)  
Take a shot for me (hooooooo-ooooooh)  
Take a shot for me (aha-aha-aha-aha-aha-aha)  
A shot for me (aha-aha-aha-aha-aha-aha)

a shot for me

Okay look, I'm honest  
Girl I can't lie, I miss you  
You and the music were the only things that I commit to  
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you  
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you  
She says I know you changed, I never see you  
'Cause you're always busy doing things

I really wish she had a different way of viewing things  
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things  
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen  
The men are jealous and the women all in competition  
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret  
And taint all your images of "Mr. Perfect"  
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer  
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover, ah  
This is one I know you hated when you heard it  
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

Take a shot for me (hooooooo-ooooooh)  
Take a shot for me (hooooooo-ooooooh)  
Take a shot for me (aha-aha-aha-aha-aha-aha)  
A shot for me (aha-aha-aha-aha-aha-aha)  
A shot for me

Yeah  
May your neighbors respect you  
Trouble neglect you, angels protect you  
And heaven accept you
# headlines

I might be too strung out on compliments  
Overdosed on confidence  
Started not to give a f- and stopped fearing the consequence  
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments  
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness  
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that  
I just take my time with all this s-, I still believe in that  
I had someone tell me I fell off, ouh I needed that  
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at  
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that  
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that  
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that  
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that  
No, don't do it  
Please don't do it  
Cause one of us goes in  
And we all go through it  
Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it

F- them other guys  
I even gave them a chance to decide  
Now it's something they know  
They know, they know, they know

Yeah, I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind  
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty  
Tell her I apologize it happened over time  
She says they missed the old drake, girl don't tempt me

If they don't get it, they'll be over you  
That new s- that you got is overdue  
You better do what you suppose to do  
I'm like why I gotta be all that but still I can't deny the fact that it's true  
Listen to you expressing all them feelings  
Soap opera rappers all these n- sound like all my children  
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing  
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions  
You know the game even got it like that  
You gone hype me up and make me catch a body like that  
Cause I live for this it isn't just a hobby like that  
When they get my s- and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know

They know, they know, they know  
They know, they know, they know  
They know, they know, they know  
Yeah, they know, yeah  
That the real is on the rise  
F- them other guys

Cups of the Ros√©  
Bitches in my old phone  
I should call one and go home  
I've been in this club too long  
The woman that I would try  
Is happy with a good guy  
But I've been drinking so much  
That I'ma call her anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad  
I know you still think about the times we had  
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found  
And since you picked up

And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO  
All my people been here

Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more  
Flights in the morning  
What you doing that's so important?  
I've been drinking so much  
That I'ma call you anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad  
I know you still think about the times we had

I'm just saying you could do better  
Tell me have you heard that lately?  
I'm just saying you could do better  
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures  
And sittin' talking 'bout bitches that we almost had  
I don't think I'm conscious of making monsters  
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad  
But shit, it's all good

We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party  
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party  
I was just calling 'cause they were just leaving  
Talk to me please don't have much to believe in

I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?  
Too many drinks have been given to me  
I got some women that's living off me  
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed  
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names  
After a while, girl, they all seem the same  
I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain

Having a hard time adjusting to fame  
Sprite in that mixture  
I've been talking crazy, girl  
I'm lucky that you picked up  
Lucky that you stayed on  
I need someone to put this weight on  
Well, I'm sorry

# under ground kings

Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape  
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder  
Can't even see it straight, I can't even see it straight  
Uh, fuck with me, I buy the shots  
Live a little, 'cause niggas die a lot  
And lie a lot but I'm the truth, that's right, I fucking said it  
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven  
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit  
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit  
I can tell a lie if you asking me my whereabouts  
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about  
Rap and bitches, rappin' bitches, bitches  
And rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches, I swear  
It's been two years since somebody asked me who I was  
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was  
That's what's important, what really happened before this  
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans  
Singing, "Walking like a man, finger on the trigger  
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah"  
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves  
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve  
That was back in the days, Acura days  
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things  
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king  
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told  
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll  
And I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga  
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga  
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga  
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)

Sometimes I need that romance  
Sometimes I need that pole dance  
Sometimes I need that stripper  
That's gon' tell me that she don't dance  
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good  
Do me like the women from my town would  
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors  
Talking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for  
Memphis, Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back  
And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack  
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth  
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south  
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like  
So why am I in class if this is who I'm tryna be like  
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade  
Soon as I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid  
And if I don't do nothing, I'ma ball  
I'm counting all day like a clock on the wall, yeah, I need that  
Making major changes to the life I'm living  
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision  
That was back in the days, Acura days  
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things  
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king  
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told  
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll  
And I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga  
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga  
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga  
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)

Summer's mine

Wish that you would come and find me  
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl, I needed that from you  
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl  
I'm spendin' time just taking care of me right now  
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl  
'Cause you'd be tired of taking care of me by now

Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh

But the good ones go  
The good ones go, if you wait too long  
But the good ones go  
The good ones go, if you wait too long  
So you should go  
You should go, before you stay too long

But don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged  
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste  
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait  
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish  
Uh, uh, I've been chillin' in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down  
In case you started to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-Town  
But when it's all done, baby, I'm yours if you're still around  
And she knows, she knows, she knows

Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh

But the good ones go  
The good ones go, if you wait too long  
But the good ones go  
The good ones go, if you wait too long  
So you should go  
You should go, before you stay too long
# doing it wrong

When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world  
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl  
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting  
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying  
And say I love you too

But I need someone different  
You know it, oh-ho, you know it  
Oh-ho, you know it, we both know it  
I need someone different  
You know it, oh-ho, you know it  
Oh-ho, you know it, we both know it  
Something's been missing  
You know it, oh-ho, she knows it  
Oh-ho, I know it, we all know it  
I need someone different (oh-ho, oh-ho)

We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together  
But we sure make it feel like we're together  
'Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you  
That's the wrong thing to do, oh (oh)  
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying  
And say I love you too

But I need someone different  
You know it, oh-ho, you know it  
Oh-ho, you know it, we both know it  
I need someone different  
You know it, oh-ho, you know it  
Oh-ho, you know it, we both know it  
Something's been missing  
You know it, oh-ho, she knows it  
Oh-ho, I know it, we all know it  
I need someone different (oh-ho, oh-ho)
# look what you've done

It's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby  
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn't ready  
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy  
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you 'cause those are deadly  
And then you ask shit and we argue about spending money on bullshit  
And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push it  
Now it's "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat"  
And I leave out and you call me, tell me that your sorry  
You love me, and I love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too  
And it's just words and they cut  
Deep but it's our world, it's just us two  
I see painkillers on the kitchen  
Counter, I hate to see, it all hurt so bad  
But maybe I wouldn't have worked as hard  
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad  
Uh, maybe I should walk up the  
Street, and try and get a job at the bank  
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks,  
We're probably gonna end up robbing a bank  
Then Wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long  
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning  
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on  
He's thinking of signing me, I come home  
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs  
I almost get a Grammy off of that thing  
They love your son and that boy gone  
You get the operation you dreamed of  
And I finally send you to Rome  
I get to make good on my promise  
It all worked out girl, we shoulda known  
Cause you deserve it

This shit real, should I pinch you?  
After all the things that we been through, I got you  
Look what you've done, look what you've done  
Look what you've done for me now  
You know that I was gonna be something

We stressed out, and you need some, I got you

Look what you've done, look what you've done

It's like '06 in your backyard and I'm in love with Jade  
And I'm still in love, just when it's that real, it doesn't fade  
And my father living in Memphis now -- he can't come this way  
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid  
Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black American dad story  
Know that I'm your sister's kid but  
That still don't explain the love that you have for me  
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances  
Damn your house feel like the Hamptons  
For all of my summer romances  
I never really had no one like you man this all new, shit  
Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it  
Had all this fighting going on at the crib  
You calm me down when I lose it  
Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music  
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far  
Talked to me, to you got to me you  
You tossed the keys and loaned me your car  
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top  
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested  
Just another kid goin' through life  
So worried that I won't be accepted  
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that  
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back

Checks bounce but we bounce back

I put all the money in your accounts back  
And I thank you, I don't know where

I'd really be without that, it worked out man

You deserve it  
This shit real, should I pinch you?  
After all the things that we been through, I got you  
Look what you've done, look what you've done  
Look what you've done for me now  
You know that I was gonna be something  
We stressed out, and you need some, I got you  
Look what you've done, look what you've done

Yeah, Cash Money shit  
Cash Money shit

I can tell that money's got you working  
We've been talking for so long  
Now we're finally here in person  
I taste pain and regret, in your sweat  
You've been waiting for me, oh ho  
I can tell that you been practicing  
I can tell that you been practicing  
All those other men were practice, they were practice  
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me

You only want what's real you just never found it  
Don't give them no more chances, ooh girl they had their turn  
Everything for a reason, there's things you had to learn from them  
But when I get you to myself

Let me put something in your life  
Let me put something in your life, put something in your life  
You telling me it's only been a couple other people that you've been with  
I'ma trust you I'ma give you the benefit of the doubt, and I'ma love you  
You can even call me daddy, I'll give you something to look up to

Where my girls from the 504, need to drop it right now  
Need to drop it right now, all my girls from the 504, need to drop it right now  
Need to drop it right now, all my girls from the 504, need to drop it right now  
Need to drop it right now, all my girls from the 504, need to drop it right now  
Need to drop it right now, oh

After you back it up then stop  
After you back it up then stop  
Baby girl, after you back it up then stop  
After you back it up then stop

I can tell that money's got you working  
Got your body so wet  
And we're finally here in person  
I taste pain and regret, in your sweat  
You've been waiting for me, oh ho  
I can tell that you been practicing  
I can tell that you been practicing  
All those other men were practice, they were practice  
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me

Yeah  
I hate when, I hate when people say they feel me man  
I hate that shit  
It'll be a long time before y'all feel me, if ever  
For real
# the ride

You won't feel me until everybody  
Say they love you, but it's not love  
And your suit is oxblood  
And the girl you fucking hates you  
And your friends faded off shots of  
What you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of  
Your famous girlfriend's ass keep getting thicker than a plot does  
And when you forget it, that's when she pop up  
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up  
Or get three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees  
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs  
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley  
Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that shit's right up your alley  
Yeah, you see a girl and you ask about her  
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour  
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down  
It's feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now  
Walking through airport security with your hat down  
Instead of getting a pat down, they just keep on  
Saying that they feel you, nigga

Yeah  
It's been too long  
Been way too long

I've been faded too long, oh  
I've been faded too long, oh  
I've been faded too long, oh  
Why won't it stop? The ride  
Why won't it stop? The ride

You won't feel me 'til you want it so bad you tell yourself you're in it  
And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished  
And steal your mother's debit cards so you maintain an image  
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted  
You need a minute? You got it  
You know it's real when your latest nights are your greatest nights  
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life  
Apartment 1503, some couches and paintings  
When you record with two others that want the same things, yeah  
It start to feel better than home feels  
And so you up there every night, you swear you getting close  
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills  
But shit, you 'bout to spend it on what matters most  
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga  
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga  
Telling stories that nobody relate to  
And even though they hate you  
They just keep on telling you they feel you, nigga

Yeah  
It's been too long, man

I've been faded too long, oh  
I've been faded too long, oh  
I've been faded too long, oh  
Why won't it stop? The ride  
Why won't it stop? The ride (uh)

I haven't been inside Terminal 1 and 3 in so long  
I'm driving right up to it now  
Make sure you got your coat on  
That runway can be cold especially after summer's rolled on  
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs  
For four months out the year, it's got you asking whats good at home  
What's good at home?  
The same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known  
My young niggas popping M's and sipping dirty Jones  
Problem children that all be repping October's Own  
Brand new girl and she still growing  
Brand new titties, stitches still showing  
Yeah, and she just praying that it heals good  
I'm 'bout to fuck and I'm just praying that it feels good  
I really don't know much but, shit, I know a secret  
They say more money more problems, my nigga don't believe it  
I mean, sure, there's some bills and taxes I'm still evading  
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazing  
Young money maker, season ticket holder  
Season switching over  
I come through them bitches still scorching as if I didn't notice  
You niggas getting older, I see no threat in Yoda  
I'm out here messing over the lives of these niggas  
That couldn't fuck with my freshman floater  
Look at that fucking chip on your nephew's shoulder  
My sophomore, I was all for it, they all saw it  
My juniors and senior will only get meaner  
Take care, nigga

I'm still faded, faded, faded (the ride)  
I'm still faded, faded, faded  
Why won't it stop? The ride  
Why won't it stop? The ride  
Why won't it stop? Oh, the ride
# tuscan leather

Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record  
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record  
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure  
Past the present when you have to mention  
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though  
'Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go  
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus  
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas  
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga  
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga  
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga  
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga  
I'm just as famous as my mentor  
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for  
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for  
'Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more  
Hot temper, scary outcome  
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one  
That always let they mouth run  
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it  
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it  
Yeah, Tom Ford tuscan leather smelling like a brick  
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit  
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich  
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup

Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV  
Young rebel, young money nothin' you could tell me  
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me  
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family  
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'  
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it  
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it  
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'  
On a mission tryna shift the culture  
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit  
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'  
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments  
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message  
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive  
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure  
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort  
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless  
I don't change like credentials, you know you see the necklace  
My life's a completed checklist  
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now  
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now  
That's real

How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?  
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento  
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo  
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk  
Off everything my pen wrote we went from bundy to winslow  
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo  
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (talk to 'em)  
The fresh prince just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie  
All these 90's fantasies on my mind  
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time  
I might come through without security to check if you're fine  
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO  
Wanted to tell you, "accept yourself"  
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself  
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help  
You know, back on your feet and shit  
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit  
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?  
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?  
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorcese  
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup  
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

If there's hell below, I'll see you when you get there  
Are you enjoying yourself?  
If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational  
Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all  
Are having the same fears, shedding similar tears  
And of course dying in so many years  
It don't mean that we can't have a good life  
So we'd like to just maybe close out with something  
Some food for thought for all of us
# furthest thing

Somewhere between psychotic and iconic  
Somewhere between I want it and I got it  
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted  
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment  
But I stay down, girl I always stay down  
Get down, have her lay down  
Promise to break everybody off before I break down  
Everyone just wait now  
So much on my plate now  
People I believed in they don't even show their face now  
What they got to say now?  
Nothing they can say now  
Nothing really changed, but still they look at me a way now  
What more can I say now?  
What more can I say now?  
You might feel like nothing was the same  
I still been drinking on the low  
Mobbin on the low  
Fuckin on the low  
Smokin on the low

Scheming on the low

I just been plotting on the low  
Scheming on the low  
The furthest thing from perfect Like everyone I know  
And I hate that you don't think that I belong to ya  
Just too busy running shit to run home to ya  
You know that paper my passion

Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened

I can't help it, I can't help it

I was young and I was selfish

I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's  
Now you hate me, stop pretending  
Stop that fronting, I can't take it  
Girl don't treat me like a stranger  
Girl you know I seen ya naked  
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender  
Getting high at the condo, that's when it all comes together  
You know I stay remniscing and makeup sex is tradition  
But you've been missing girl and you might feel like nothing was the same  
I still been drinking on the low  
Mobbin on the low  
Fuckin on the low  
Smokin on the low  
I still been plotting on the low

My mama told me this was right for me  
I got em worried like make sure you save a slice for me  
I should have spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me  
Your actions make us doubt you  
Your lack of effort got me rapping different  
This the shit I wanna go out to  
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin  
Naked women swimming that's just how I'm living  
Donate a million to some children that's just how I'm feeling  
A nigga filling up arenas who the fuck can see us  
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up 'fore I got the re-up  
Yours truly the boy  
I just build and build more y'all niggas build and destroy  
Y'all niggas party too much man I just chill and record  
No filler you feel it now if you ain't feel it before  
Yes Lord  
This the shit I wanna go out to  
Yeah.yeah  
This the shit I wanna go out to

Workin' all night, traffic on the way home  
And my uncle calling me like, "Where ya at?  
I gave you the keys told you bring it right back"

There ain't really much I hear that's poppin' off without us, nigga  
We just want the credit where it's due  
I'ma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you  
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself  
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house

'Cause we started from the bottom, now we're here

# wu-tang forever

Uh, uh, uh, ah

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten  
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then  
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours (it's yours)  
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours (it's yours)  
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that  
What made me think about the game, girl  
And how I switched it up with a new thang  
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang  
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours (it's yours)  
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours  
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours (it's yours)  
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, that's for sure, that's for sure, yeah  
(It's yours, it's yours, it's yours)  
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, that's for sure, that's for sure  
(It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours)

How you feel about, coming home with a, nigga for the night?  
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite  
'Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good  
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like

Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back  
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map  
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first  
It's about who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"  
Open cases on me for a half a million each  
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets  
I know, luckily I didn't have to grow there  
I would only go there cause there's niggas that I know there  
I don't know what's getting into me  
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club  
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy  
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be  
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me  
Start to become a distant memory  
Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy  
And fucking with me mentally, I think it's meant to be, yeah  
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys  
But you gotta understand when it's yours  
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

Ah, I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten  
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then  
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours (it's yours)  
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours (it's yours)  
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that  
What made me think about the game, girl  
And how I switched it up with a new thang  
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang  
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours (it's yours)  
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours  
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours  
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, that's for sure, that's for sure, yeah  
(It's yours, it's yours, it's yours)  
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, that's for sure, that's for sure  
(It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours)

Go own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit (own it, own it)  
Go and own that shit, own that shit, own that shit (own it, own it)

Niggas talk more than bitches these days  
Just let that shit sink in  
Niggas talk more than bitches these days  
Who could get the pussy quicker these days  
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days  
'Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days (trippin')  
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story  
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry" (now ya know)  
Couple bitches tryin' to have me on the Maury like nigga it's yours  
You should be supportin' but where you been at? On tour, gettin' money  
Y'all don't even really check for me  
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me  
Girl, you don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me  
Girl, cause you got the Batphone in my workline (work)  
You should call it (yeah)  
When the last time you did something for the first time?  
You have done it all, swear to God (yeah)  
Niggas talk more than bitches these days  
Got you thinkin' I'm different these days  
Broken telephone for every single conversation  
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days  
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's always gonna be yours

Mothafucka never loved us  
Fucka never loved us  
You ain't know, now you know now  
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush

But your shit is like the police askin' us questions  
Nigga, we don't know shit  
Flexin'  
Nigga, I'm just flexin'  
Nigga never loved us  
Do it look like we stressin'?  
Look at you, look at you and look at you  
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us  
'Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish  
Just to see if I'm finished

On my worst behavior, no?  
They used to never want to hear us  
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us  
Remember? Mothafucka!  
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us

I'm on my worst behavior  
Don't you ever get it fucked up  
Mothafuckas never loved us

Hold up, hold my phone  
Mothafuckas never loved us

So everywhere we go now, full cup  
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man  
Mothafucka, I done grown up  
You know me? You know me?  
I'm liable to do anything  
When it comes to that you owe me  
You owe me, you owe me  
Bitch you better have my money

Who's hot, who not?  
Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?  
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks  
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?  
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed  
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game  
I just ask for some blessins at my grandmother's grave

And it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check  
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net  
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib  
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left  
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside  
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine  
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai  
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high  
My momma probably hear that and be mortified  
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura  
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside  
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized  
Yeah, back and forth across the border line  
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime  
Gone all the time, even the important times  
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

Remember? Remember?  
Mothafucka! Remember?  
Hold up, hold my phone  
They used to never want to hear us  
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us

Here's the pitch  
It's belted deep to center, Revere goes back  
jumps at the wall, and it's gone!"

Yeah, isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication  
How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing  
How every conversation starts with "this time will be different"  
Oh, the idea is fun, oh, the idea is fun  
Oh, the idea is so fun every time  
At least we try for home run every time

Don't talk to me like I'm famous (I'm famous)  
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae  
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' bae  
Yeah, swangin', ay

She just wanna run around the city and make memories  
That she can barely remember  
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power, yeah  
She just wanna run over my feelings  
Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler  
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power  
She used to say "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"  
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself  
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down  
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground  
Wish you would learn to love people and use things  
And not the other way around

Swangin', eyes closed just swangin'  
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me  
Same city, same friends if you're looking  
I'll be here just swangin', ay  
Don't talk to me like I'm famous, ay  
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae  
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby  
I'll be here, just swangin'

(Swang, swang, swang, swang  
Swang it up, swang it up, swang it up  
Swang it up, swang it up, swang it up, hey)

I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is  
She call and tell me be here before the sun up  
I be dressed before we hung up  
I take Eglinton to 401 east  
And exit at Markham road in the east end  
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping  
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend  
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends  
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness  
I hate stoppin' for gas this late  
'Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'  
Summer is comin' know you could feel it  
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it  
Won't knock on your door  
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"  
I got the pedal to the floor  
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'

Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there  
I'll be there just swangin'  
I'll be there just swangin'  
I treat you good girl like you're famous  
I know I'm late it's always the same shit  
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there, yeah, yeah

Bank account statements just look like I'm ready for early retirement  
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction  
Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum  
I am the kid with the motor mouth

I am the one that you should worry about

I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?  
Someone just talking that bullshit, man someone just gave you the run-around

Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down  
I don't waste time putting money down

I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash  
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour  
And you gotta fly in first class  
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city  
They know I come right every summer

Cash Money Records forever  
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna  
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell  
I will never understand that but oh well

Okay, now you're talking my language

Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you  
She just want to smoke and fuck I said "Girl, that's all that we do"  
I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited  
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited

I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence  
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do  
People are funny you don't even know about the shit that I been through  
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple  
Talking that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me  
Come get your girl, she been here for three days  
And she way too attached to me  
Hate when they get too attached to me  
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road  
Get what I can out the country  
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold  
Can't even drive with the top off  
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer  
I just might bring in some girls from Miami  
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna  
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell

# too much

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
Oh-oh, don't think about...

Done sayin' I'm done playin'  
Last time was on the outro  
Stuck in the house, need to get out more  
I've been stackin' up like I'm fund-raisin'

Most people in my position get complacent  
Wanna come places with star girls, and they end up on them front pages  
I'm quiet but I just ride with it  
Moment I stop havin' fun with it, I'll be done with it  
I'm the only one that's puttin' shots up  
And like a potluck, you need to come with it

Don't run from it, H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100  
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted  
I was birthed there in my first year  
Man, I know that place like I come from it  
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun comin'?"  
"Fuck that, is any one comin' 'fore I show up there and ain't no one there?"

These days, I could probably pack it for like 20 nights if I go in there  
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out  
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now  
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out  
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about bein' the best out"

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
Oh-oh, don't think about...

Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods  
Money got my whole family goin' backwards  
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'  
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'

I did not sign up for this  
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list  
And now he's actin' like "Oh well, this is life, I guess"  
Nah, fuck that shit  
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do  
You gotta trust that shit

Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign  
That's when they appear  
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here  
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, tellin' herself  
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit

All my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round  
Started treatin' me like I'm "him" now  
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now  
Shit got me feelin' pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down  
I'm writin' to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you

Oh-ooh-oh  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush this through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you, oh, oh
# come thru

We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon  
And nothing was the same

When I should've went home  
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own  
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib  
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way  
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past  
I can still get you wet and I can still make you laugh  
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask  
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something

Girl you know we got thangs to do  
So get your ass in that car and come through

Girl you know we got thangs to do  
Girl you know we got thangs to do  
So get your ass in that car and come through

Last night I brought DOA to the studio  
They already had a stage and a booty pole  
It's supposed to be a lot of hard working going on  
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on  
Someone put a order in for a chicken  
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen  
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up  
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?  
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different ya know?  
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?  
And ya know I need ya back in my life  
Girl ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like  
Girl you got that thing for real  
When I was on a mission to make it  
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?  
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?  
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something

Come through, come through, come through, come through  
Girl you know we got thangs to do  
Girl you know we got thangs to do  
So get your ass in that car and come through

Come through, come through, come through, come through  
Girl you know we got thangs to do

So get your ass in that car and come through

# keep family close

It's a little chilly out there  
How you can stand there is beyond me

All of my "let's just be friends"  
Are friends I don't have anymore  
How do you not check on me when things go wrong?  
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer, much closer  
All of my "let's just be friends"  
Are friends I don't have anymore  
Guess it's what they say you need family for  
'Cause I can't depend on you anymore

Always saw you for what you could've been  
Ever since you met me like when Chrysler made that one car  
That looked just like the Bentley  
I always saw you for what you could've been  
And even when it's business with you it's personal again  
I knew you before you made ends meet  
And now we're meeting out end

And it's all because you chose a side  
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me  
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)  
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

You're so predictable, I hate people like you  
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you  
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through?  
You can't even figure out what's going on with you  
You judge me 'fore you met me, yeah, it figures  
I make all the players anthems for the real niggas  
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong  
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on (yeah)

I don't know what's going on  
And it's all because you chose a side  
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me  
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)  
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align  
My luck is a sure thing 'cause I'm living right  
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice  
But you always had something to say every other time  
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way  
I'm fooding and serving 'em all like I work for minimum wage  
Someone up there must just love testing my patience  
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment  
Forgiveness for your ways  
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya, that's how I was raised  
Same way I'm right here still feeling a way  
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that

All of my "let's just be friends"  
Are friends I don't have anymore  
How do you not check on me when things go wrong?  
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer, much closer  
All of my "let's just be friends"  
Are friends I don't have anymore  
Guess it's what they say you need your family for  
'Cause I can't depend on you anymore  
Much closer

Any time people wanna start problems  
It's like "for real, are you dumb?"  
You know who mans are?  
Not afraid no gyal heart man  
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie  
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither  
So anybody who want it can get it  
Seh feh
# 9

Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know  
Man when shit gets like this, in the whole city  
Shit's crazy right now, this shit ain't gonna stop  
You know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

Look  
Mama hit my phone and said rap's no good  
Better than her telling me the check's no good  
Now they wanna act like I do no good  
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should  
I made a decision last night that I would die for it  
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it  
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it  
You know 40 wants peace, but I'm down to cut ties for it  
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one  
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one  
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it  
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it  
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it  
Same way, brands gotta break for it  
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now  
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now  
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

All these hand outs, man, it's getting outta hand  
I'ma start telling niggas "Get it how you can"  
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend  
If I ever lose, I bet we never speak again  
I made a decision last night I'd die for it  
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it  
First place, first place, man, we can't be tied for it  
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it  
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things  
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away  
Six upside down, it's a nine now  
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now  
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it
# you with me?

On some DMX shit  
I group DM my exes  
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever  
And I think we just get closer when we're not together  
You tell me that I'm confusin'  
More immature than Marcus Houston  
Cut's too deep for a band-aid solution  
We too deep in this thing to never lose me  
L-O-L-O-L, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'  
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off  
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras  
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars  
That's why she's always correctin' me when my time is off  
And my house is the definition  
Of alcohol and weed addiction  
You got a different vision  
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen  
Without runnin' into one of my niggas  
That's not the way we livin'  
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic  
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em  
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people  
But every time we speakin'

It's like a lot of games bein' played  
How's it goin' down?  
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now  
Is you wit' me or what?  
Yeah

It's like a lot of games are bein' played  
How's it goin' down?  
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now  
Is you wit' me or what?

Yeah  
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs  
Where you get at me  
All that grey in our conversation history, you  
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things  
Playin' mind games, we both doin' the same thing  
Slide on a late night  
You like to slide on a late night  
You sent a, "Are you here?" text without an invite  
That's that shit that I don't like  
We both, slide on a late night  
Do things in our off time  
We both, yeah  
Made some mistakes, pon road  
Yeah, how's that for real?  
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal  
Three dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still  
While you're typin' make sure to tell me

What type of games are bein' played?  
How's it goin' down?  
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now  
Is you wit' me or what?  
Yeah

What type of games are bein' played?  
How's it goin' down?  
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now  
Is you wit' me or what?

Yeah  
Remember you was livin' at the London for a month  
Service elevator up to 4201  
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front  
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front  
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'  
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different  
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things  
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade that they throwin'  
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need  
And on my way to make this dough  
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow  
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow (oh)  
Tryna give your ass the world  
You runnin' your fingers through my curls  
You knew me when the kid had waves  
But that's enough of that  
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass  
And that's some real shit
# feel no ways

I should be downtown, whippin' on the way to you  
You got somethin' that belongs to me  
Your body language says it all  
Despite the things you said to me  
Who is it that's got you all gassed up? (yeah)  
Changin' your opinion on me  
I was only gone for the last few months  
But you don't have the time to wait on me (yeah)

I tried with you  
There's more to life than sleepin' in and gettin' high with you  
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do  
And that just didn't sit right with you (yeah)  
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose  
Now you're throwin' it back in my face, on purpose  
Now you're talkin' down on my name, on purpose (yeah)  
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it

Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way  
I've stopped listenin' to things you say  
'Cause you don't mean it anyway (yeah)  
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way  
Maybe we just should have did things my way  
Instead of the other way

I tried with you  
There's more to life than sleepin' in and gettin' high with you  
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do  
And that just didn't sit right with you (yeah)  
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose

# hype

Man don't live of a di hype, huh?  
Real ting, ay

Yeah, I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07  
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one  
Last year I know you learned your lesson  
I could GPS you if you need addressin'  
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie  
But I'm one year older than my lil' homie  
'09 they was biddin' on me  
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me

Ok, now we got some action  
Everything I said, it happened  
That boy light as Michael Jackson  
But on verses, he been blackin'  
Chasin' women a distraction  
They wan' be on TV right next to me  
You cannot be here right next to me  
Don't you see Riri right next to me?

I hate a rapper especially  
They feel the same, but they hide it  
They just discuss it in private  
Don't get along, man, we tried it  
What's the point in even tryin'?  
I hate a goofy especially  
They always dyin' to mention me  
They gotta die out eventually  
I cannot give you the recipe  
You know the game is sold separately  
Swear I just had an epiphany  
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's  
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie  
They used to always come check for me  
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies  
I don't let it get to me

Done  
Look what I've done in my life  
I had to count it and count it again  
To make sure the money was right  
They love to talk  
Me, I'm just dunnin' the hype  
Me, I'm just dunnin' the hype  
Me, I'm just done, done, done, done, done

I don't take this shit for granted, I do my own propaganda  
I feel like Juelz Santana, leg hangin' out the Phantom  
6 cold like Alaska, Views already a classic  
Roy outta here like NASA, bustin' 1's out the plastic  
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her  
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious  
I feed my family with this  
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious  
I don't run out of material  
You shouldn't speak on me, period  
You try to give 'em your side of the story  
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it

They feelin' a way and won't hide it  
Niggas done bein' silent  
Don't get along, man, we tried it  
What's the point of even tryin'?  
I hate a goofy especially  
They always dyin' to mention me  
They gotta go, they gotta go  
They gonna die out eventually  
I cannot give 'em no empathy  
I'ma have B's when I'm 70  
They cannot fuck with the legacy  
I don't know what else is left for me  
After this no one a threat to me  
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies  
I don't let it get to me

Done  
Look what I've done in my life  
I had to count it and count it again  
To make sure the money was right  
They love to talk  
Me, I'm just done in the hype  
Me, I'm just done in the hype  
Me, I'm just done, done, done, done, done
# weston road flows

Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny  
Back when we couldn't buy pizza 'cause we were down to pennies  
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries  
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it  
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement  
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment  
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission  
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him

Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know  
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show  
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, "What are those?"  
I mean, you boys not even coming close  
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration  
You number one, and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places  
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear  
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care

No tender love and care, no love and affection  
I got a price on my head, but there's a risk to collect it  
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson  
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together  
Yeah, but here we are, and it's a new semester  
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure  
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'  
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation

Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day  
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday  
You don't be scorin' perfect  
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'  
You platinum like wrappers  
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless  
You get the message over and over like it was urgent  
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person  
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in  
And did it with a purpose

Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships  
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension  
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned  
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention  
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder  
The most successful rapper, 35 and under  
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under  
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded

Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin  
She violated, I sent her back where it all started  
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment  
Leave it to niggas like you to show 'em light in the darkness  
Told my momma that I found a lady in the East  
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite  
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free  
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me

You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique  
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats  
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat  
Now the talk of the corner store is I'm TBE  
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better  
But shit ain't how it always seems when it's so together  
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it

Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled  
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal  
Don't let your newfound fame fool you  
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this  
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter  
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit  
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it

Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it  
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements  
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'  
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it  
And they still take to it  
Big Apple had the white Hummer parked right in front of Fluid  
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it  
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful

But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want  
Get high when I want, yeah, that's right, yeah
# redemption

Yeah, I get it  
I get it, yeah

Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?  
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?  
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?  
Why do I want an independent woman  
To feel like she needs me? I lost my way

I'm searchin' for these words to say to you  
Please give me time  
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you  
Oh, please give me time  
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now  
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah  
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah

Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else  
I gave your nickname to someone else  
I know you're seein' someone that loves you  
And I don't want you to see no one else  
I don't want you here with no one else  
I don't wanna do this with no one else  
I used to know you back when you was young  
Your brother brought me through, you saw me  
That made me think of you so differently  
I miss the feeling of you missing me  
But you say you're over and done with me  
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Redemption's on your mind when you (think about me)  
Aw, please give me time  
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words  
To say to you right now, yeah

Say to you- but 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah  
Say to you- a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'  
Was for me and you, girl  
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?  
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you  
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you  
And they both say that you're over and done with me  
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah

They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah  
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Aww, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Redemption's on your mind when you-  
Aw, please give me time  
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

Damn  
I'm not unrealistic with none of my women  
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it  
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision  
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment  
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me  
That mean a lot to me, not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me  
This year for Christmas I just want apologies  
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'  
Syn had a baby and treated me different  
Erika sued me and opened a business  
Wonder if they wish it could've been different  
Wonder what they'd do put in my position  
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?  
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions  
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven  
Tryna satisfy everybody  
It's like they can't get enough  
Until enough is enough  
And then it's too much  
You tip the scale when I weigh my options  
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten  
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'  
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems  
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'  
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet  
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit  
Sell my secrets and get top dollar  
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover  
Opportunity and temptation  
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation  
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'  
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?  
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'  
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'  
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

Yeah  
I know

This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney  
They don't need to know all of our business  
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex  
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it  
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage  
Then you find it, awkward silence  
Mama is a saint, yes, she raised me real good  
All because of her I don't do you like I should  
Don't make me give you back to the hood  
Don't make me give you back

# pop style

Dropped outta school now we dumb rich, dumb rich  
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit, one shit  
All my niggas wanna do is pop style, pop style  
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle, lifestyle

Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it  
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum, they do  
And I like to finish what you think you started  
Man you boys just got to Hollywood  
You boys just started  
You don't know what you just started  
All I do is hang with the young and heartless  
All this is for my family, man, I try my hardest  
It's all I ever did and look where it got him  
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately  
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me  
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way  
But you know I always handle that one my way  
Girl, let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body  
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway  
I can't trust no fuckin' body  
They still out to get me cause they never got me

They still out to get me, they don't get it  
I can not be gotten, that's a given  
They like Pablo why are all the windows tinted in your Tahoe?  
Why do you know every single bitch that I know?  
Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?  
Fuck if I know, that's that Chicago, aye  
South, south, side, that's the motto, aye  
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel

Question is will I ever leave you?  
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no  
Question is will I ever leave you?  
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no

Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure  
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham  
A lot of pent up aggression coming out of my section  
OVO on me while y'all n-s was playing dress-up  
And I know who gon' take the fall with me  
They right here on call with me, they all with me  
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted  
They been saying it's love, but it isn't love, is it?

Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me  
I worked at JD's connections whenever Jason let me  
Ceesay's, I was buying fitteds everyday  
Kenny's caravan and trying not to catch a stray  
I dropped out right before I graduate  
Six credits left, my mama had a saddest day  
"It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait"  
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say

Lately I just feel so out of character  
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance  
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist  
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison  
I'm getting straight to the point with it  
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all n-  
F- being all buddy buddy with the opposition  
It's like a front of the plane, n-, it's all business  
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards them goals  
My n-s still hit the club when it's 20 below  
Who you think running this show?  
You saw it in me at 20 years old  
The lingo start to sound like we talking in code

I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate  
You don't worry 'bout fitting in when you custom made  
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change  
Now me and Kobe doing shots the night before the game  
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system  
Numbers going unlisted just to create some distance  
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya  
N- quick to double cross like both of us Christian

Lamborghini got me feeling like I'm Christian Bale  
And I never bare my morals for the ticket sales  
Tipping scales, bars heavy like triple XL  
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself  
Running through the 6, storming through the contracts  
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts  
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon  
I still got something left to prove since you left me room

Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus  
And like it's going in a trunk, I put it all behind us  
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever  
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together  
And my life is on display like Truman  
They wanna pre the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner  
My exes made some of my favorite music  
I dated women from my favorite movies  
Karma's such a thing of beauty

I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it  
It's far fetched like I threw that sh- a hundred meters  
I keep it 100 like I'm running a fever  
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you  
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either
# hotline bling

You used to call me on my  
You used to, you used to  
Yeah

You used to call me on my cell phone  
Late night when you need my love  
Call me on my cell phone  
Late night when you need my love  
And I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  
I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you  
Got a reputation for yourself now  
Everybody knows and I feel left out  
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out  
Cause ever since I left the city, you  
Started wearing less and goin' out more  
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor  
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone  
Late night when you need my love  
Call me on my cell phone  
Late night when you need my love  
I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  
I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you  
You and me, we just don't get along  
You make me feel like I did you wrong  
Going places where you don't belong  
Ever since I left the city, you  
You got exactly what you asked for  
Running out of pages in your passport  
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone  
Late night when you need my love  
Call me on my cell phone  
Late night when you need my love  
And I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  
I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is  
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else  
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else  
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else  
You don't need no one else  
You don't need nobody else, no  
Why you never alone  
Why you always touching road  
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl  
You was in the zone, yeah  
You should just be yourself  
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone  
Late night when you need my love  
Call me on my cell phone  
Late night when you need my love  
And I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  
I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city...
# deep pockets

For my nigga Hush  
Yeah, look

Dressed in fatigues, I rep the East with my trustees  
Smokin' on crushed leaves  
They turn they back on everything we built, then they must bleed  
I've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze  
Scraps over territory they know we must keep  
Get home and white Air Forces get brushed clean

Back when my mama would interrupt sleep  
To tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves  
Summertime heatwaves, I used to just cut sleeves  
My shawty really love me, man, she want me to cut keys  
I can't do that normal type of life, is it just me?  
Niggas steady try to ride the wave, but it's rough seas

I'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy  
And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy  
It's on Meech like it's trendy  
Runnin' round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the city's empty, yeah  
Early twenties, but I want fifties, hundreds, not pennies  
I need plenty

Got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi  
Whatever's in me, it's takin' over  
I gotta bust it down, break it open  
Until somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'

Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'  
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in  
Now we rollin'  
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'  
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in  
Now we rollin'

Look  
Back when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing  
Back when the house that I own now was my home screen  
Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team  
Runnin' missions  
Pyramid schemes just like the Egyptians  
Back when hotlines were still flippin'

Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different  
Transitions, plans switchin', ambition  
Mindin' my business, buildin' a business, etcetera  
Inspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla  
I always had a little somethin' extra  
Back when Corey was our sole investor  
And the car could get from A to B, but won't impress ya

Look, I ain't no baller  
Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller  
My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers  
And easin' tensions  
Keepin' family out of East Detention  
And out of Pine Hill's Funeral Center  
Spots we got no business enterin'  
Back when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye  
I had to find a way to get someone's attention

Then we rollin', then we rollin'  
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in  
Now we rollin'  
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'  
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in  
Now we rollin'
# when to say when

Yeah, somebody on  
Somebody hit me today and they were like  
"Nah, just make sure, you know  
You tell me what to do when I get there, you know?"  
(June, you're a genius)  
I said, I respect it, no problem  
I got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway  
Know what I'm sayin'?  
Yeah  
My hand's always open, for real

Ayy, thirty-three years, I gave that to the game  
Thirty-three mil, I save that for the ring  
Five hundred weeks, I fill the charts with my pain  
Five hundred mil and I fall back in the 6ix  
Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist  
Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids  
Still women sayin' it's childish the way we live  
Brought a few Ws to the 6ix  
Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is  
Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit  
Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit  
Other times, I question if compliments are legit  
Full-time, I'm out here, confident as a bitch  
Tryna make good on the promises that I give  
Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit  
Register the business in my brother's name  
Thirty-five hunnid in the pocket, that should cover things  
Certified loverman, trappin' out the motherland  
Always move right, so my watch is on the other hand  
She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan  
People wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand  
My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands  
Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans  
Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can  
I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands  
I decide what to see next like it's on demand  
I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans  
I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman  
I will split heads and break necks for my little man  
6 God, praying hands like I'm a religious man  
But I'm just a sicker man, wicked man  
Look, we can argue back and forth, but who's the richer man?  
Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?  
Bang those dividends, snakes stay slitherin'  
How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' it?  
How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?  
How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?  
How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again  
How you got a manager you met after you got the win?  
Bet you got some niggas that'll love you to the bitter end  
Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends  
Give 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then  
You just need to stay close to your people  
That was there when others could've been  
Then when others should've been  
Got a nigga starin' at the game like, "damn coach, put him in"  
But you never listen, so you niggas going wood again  
Got us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been  
And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in  
And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend  
And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge  
It's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men  
It's because, even though you hate on me, we stay friends  
It's because you niggas never learn when to say when, yeah

For real  
Facts, you know what I'm sayin'  
Yeah

You believe in angles more than angels

Feel like I've been going through too much to explain to you  
But I'm still the same way I was when I came to you  
Everything I have, what I had to exchange for you  
Everything I've been through, I can't even complain to you

# losses

Hey, Instagram  
This is a song I've been writing, oh, for a few months  
I don't know, I, I started writing it about family  
Just came up now, so  
Anybody feel any way about it, I don't give a fuck  
(Yeah, family)

Yeah  
Yeah  
Lost you to the game, I gotta hug that  
I was here when you was asking "where the love at?"  
Dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back  
I was wishin' on a star when I was that  
I've been fortunate enough to have it my way  
I'm a fortune teller, listen to what I say  
'Member when we used to park up in my driveway  
I always told it how it was, I never shy away  
This life is really something you get lost in  
I know niggas that got famous and they bought friends  
I had friends that only had half of they heart in  
It's hard to accept now, and it was hard then  
But I treated you like gold, I was all in  
Spoiled rotten, they could smell you 'fore you walked in  
Burnin' incense in your new apartment  
But you got no sense when it come to

Lost you to the game, I gotta hold that  
How you feelin' in your soul since you sold that?  
I'll be better off without you, and we know that  
You ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back  
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap  
You sold me up the river, but I rowed back  
You put me on the road without a road map  
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts

You got some liquor at the house?  
(Yeah)  
Go get a shot, let's do a shot together  
(I don't see it)  
(Okay)

Ayy  
Being here wasn't in the plans  
I do it for the Grahams, not the 'Gram  
I do it for the fam, but still fuckin' Uncle Sam  
I tried to change for you, but that wasn't who I am  
Even when being real is out of fashion  
Niggas keep stealin' my style, now we out here matchin'  
I did it by being myself with no dramatic acting  
I couldn't sit around and wait, I had to have it happen  
Lost you to the game, I gotta face that  
Really think I lost you like a ways back  
Always sayin' how a nigga never played fair  
I took you up under my wing and you just stayed there  
You was supposed to grow some wings, get your own pair  
We started this from the bottom, now you alone there  
Shit, you treat it like it's home there  
Dependent on me, you was supposed to get your own share  
I still love you to my last days  
I never knew that shit would be this fast-paced  
I never thought I'd see awards in a glass case  
I could've ended up in your crib with a masked face  
It could've went left on a couple bad days  
When I visit my last place is the only time I'm in last place  
See me these days, I never got on a sad face  
See me these days, I

Lost you to the game, and I see why  
It was always you and I without the T-Y  
This is not one of them stories that got three sides  
This is not one of them stories you could rewind  
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap  
You drove a nigga crazy, but I drove back  
You wrote me off and then you never wrote back  
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts

Yes, sir (baby)  
Hold on, hold on (let me tell you something about me)  
(I really do know, I know who I wanna be)  
Woo  
Lord, I already (woo) passed on all that  
You go 'head on
