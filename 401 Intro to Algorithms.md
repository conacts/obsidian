## The Role of Algorithms in Computing

### 1.1 Algorithms
##### Algorithm
A well defined sequence of computational steps that transform the input into an output

##### Comptutaional Problem
A problem solved through the use of an algorithm due to it's computational complexity

##### Data Structures
A way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications. Each structure has it's pros and cons as "one size does not fit all"

##### Technique
