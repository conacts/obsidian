##### (1.1.1) Symbolic AI
The idea that with a large enough number of handcoded rules, we could achieve human level intellgence. This idea, is obviously not correct, but was a dominant idea from around the 1950s to 1980s. 

##### (1.1.2) Machine Learning
The idea that instead of explicitly programming rules into a computer, you provide it data and the answers so the machine can learn the rules within that data.
- A machine learning system is **trained** rather than explicitly programmed.
- Although machine learning started in the 1990s, it has quickly become the largest subfield of AI.
- Machine learning is especially useful due to it's ability to deal with large, complex datasets like millions of images with thousands of pixels. This sets it in a category of its own when comparing it to normal statistical analysis like Bayesian analysis. 
- Machine learning is moreso regarded as an engineering problem as much of the field is still unknown

##### (1.1.3) Learning Representations From Data
To preform machine learning we need to meet 3 criteria
1. Input data
2. Expected output
3. A way to measure how well our algorithm is performing

- A major problem in machine learning is representing data properly so the algorithm can process the data meaningfully

###### Data processing examples
> Input Data: Image
> Encoded Data: Image in RGB format
