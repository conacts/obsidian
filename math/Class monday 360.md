Propositional Statement: A statement that is either true or false but not both. Written in the form of declarative sentences

##### Propositional Logic
Definiton: A logical expression made up of propositional variables and logical connectives

Prescedence: Similar to PEMDAS, the way in which you operate on a logical statement

| Operators                           | prescedence |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------- |
| $\lnot$                             | 1           |
| $\lor \quad \land$                  | 2           |
| $\rightarrow \quad \leftrightarrow$ | 3           |


Tautology: a proposition which is always true:
$$p \vee \lnot p$$
Contradiction: a propositional statement that is always false
$$p \wedge \lnot p$$
Contigngency: a propositional statement where it is neither a tautology nor a contradiction

Logical Equivalence: Two compound propositions are logically equivalent if they always have the same truth values

| Sign      | English                        | Latex   |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------- |
| $\equiv$  | exactly equals (1/2 $\ne$ 2/4) | \equiv  |
| $\approx$ | reasonably right            | \approx |




Connectives: Negation, Conjection disjunction, Exclusive or conditional biconditional
Conditional: $\rightarrow$  "if then" 
Conjunction: $\wedge$ and
Disjunction: $\vee$ or
Negation: $\lnot$ not
Conditional: $\rightarrow$ if-then
Exculsive OR / XOR: $\oplus$
Biconditional: $\leftrightarrow$ p if and only if q

| p   | q   | p $\leftrightarrow$ q |
| --- | --- | --------------------- |
| T   | T   | True                  |
| F   | T   | False                 |
| T   | F   | False                 |
| F   | F   | True                  |

Propositional: 
Converse: Meaning q implies p
Contrapositive: not q implies not p
Inverse: if not p, then not q
